Question #1 Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

A request handler with access to the application's request-response cycle is
known as widdleware. It is a function that holds the request object, and the middleware 
function. Middleware can also send the response to the server before the request.

Question # 2 What does CRUD stand for?

CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE
CRUD is the acronym for CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE. These
terms describe the four essential operations for creating and 
managing persistent data elements, mainly in relational and 
NoSQL databases.

Question #3 You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.

The .gitignore file in the 03-task-manager/starter directory contains lines for /node_modules 
and .env which are files we don/t need on Github.
